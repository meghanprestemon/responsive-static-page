In order to get things up-and-running with minimal effort, this assignment package is pre-configured to run a local server, as well as handle SCSS and JS compiling.

### Setup
- Clone this repo.
- Using your terminal, navigate to the repo directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Once finished, run `npm run dev` to start a local server through Browsersync. Once it's running, a window will open in your default browser with a local URL to access the local server.
- All SCSS and JS compiling will automatically happen when a file is saved. SCSS will be compiled to `app.min.css`, and `app.js` will be compiled to `app.min.js`.

### Objectives
- Using the provided wireframes as a guide, build out a single static page.
- The page should be responsive, with styles to accommodate mobile viewports and desktop viewports, based on what's shown in the wireframes.
- On mobile viewports, the main header nav menu should collapse and set to toggle using the menu button.
- As an extra step, modal functionality can be developed for the "Learn More" buttons shown in the "icon blocks". The modal should show an expanded version of the icon block with additional content.

### Notes
- The wireframes can be found in the `/_wireframes` folder within this repo. A PDF is provided in case Sketch isn't available.
- The produced page doesn't need to be exact to the wireframes, in terms of margins, font sizes, copy used, etc., but should be similar and have the same overall look.
- All images used in the wireframes can be found in the `/images` folder.
- jQuery can be utilized, if desired. However, please refrain from using any other libraries/frameworks for handling the above objectives, such as Bootstrap, etc.
- Browser support should include all major, modern browsers, as well as IE 11.

### Deliverable
- When finished, create a zip file containing the entire package (excluding the `node_modules` and `_wireframes` directories), and send it to your point-of-contact for the hiring process.
